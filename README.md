# Is there a greenium on corporate bonds?
The green bond market has increased rapidly in recent years and whether green bonds provide cheaper funding to issuers by trading at a premium is still an open debate. The aim of this paper is to assess whether there exists a greenium. The analysis is based on a dataset containing information about the companies that issued both green and brown bonds, the yield to maturity, issue date, amount issued and the country of issue. Four methodologies have been employed, all resulting in a non- statistically significant coefficient for the dummy variable green bonds, suggesting that there exists no greenium. Therefore we conclude that the spread between green and brown bonds is non- negative, meaning that green bonds are not traded at a premium.
